SciPy Code of Conduct
=====================


Introduction
------------

This code of conduct applies to all spaces managed by the SciPy project,
including all public and private mailing lists, issue trackers, wikis, blogs,
Twitter, and any other communication channel used by our community.  The SciPy
project does not organise in-person events, however we expect events related
to our community to have a code of conduct similar in spirit to this one.

We expect this code of conduct to be honored by everyone who participates in
the SciPy community formally or informally, or claims any affiliation with the
project, in any project-related activities and especially when representing the
project, in any role.

This code is not exhaustive or complete. It serves to distill our common
understanding of a collaborative, shared environment and goals. We expect it to
be followed in spirit as much as in letter, to create a friendly and productive
environment that enriches the surrounding community.


Specific Guidelines
-------------------

We strive to:

1. Be open. We invite anyone to participate in our community. We preferably use
   public methods of communication for project-related messages, unless
   discussing something sensitive. This applies to messages for help or
   project-related support, too; not only is a public support request much more
   likely to result in an answer to a question, it also ensures that any
   inadvertent mistakes in answering are more easily detected and corrected.

2. Be empathetic, welcoming, friendly, and patient. We work together to resolve
   conflict, assume good intentions, and do our best to act in an empathetic
   fashion. We may all experience some frustration from time to time, but we do
   not allow frustration to turn into a personal attack. A community where
   people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.

3. Be collaborative. Our work will be used by other people, and in turn we will
   depend on the work of others. When we make something for the benefit of the
   project, we are willing to explain to others how it works, so that they can
   build on the work to make it even better. Any decision we make will affect
   users and colleagues, and we take those consequences seriously when making
   decisions.

3. Be inquisitive. Nobody knows everything! Asking questions early avoids many
   problems later, so questions are encouraged, though they may be directed to
   the appropriate forum. Those who are asked should be responsive and helpful,
   within the context of our shared goal of improving SciPy project code,
   documentation and other content.

4. Be careful in the words that we choose. Whether we are participating as
   professionals or volunteers, we value professionalism in all interactions,
   and take responsibility for our own speech. Be kind to others. Do not insult
   or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behaviour
   are not acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:

    - Violent threats or language directed against another person.
    - Sexist, racist, or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.
    - Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
    - Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying information ("doxing").
    - Sharing private content, such as emails sent privately or non-publicly, or unlogged forums such as IRC channel history.
    - Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.
    - Unwelcome sexual attention.
    - Excessive profanity.
    - Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.
    - Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour.


Diversity Statement
-------------------

The SciPy project welcomes and encourages participation by everyone. We are
committed to being a community that everyone enjoys being part of. Although
we may not always be able to accommodate each individual's preferences, we try
our best to treat everyone kindly.

No matter how you identify yourself or how others perceive you: we welcome you.
Though no list can hope to be comprehensive, we explicitly honour diversity in:
age, culture, ethnicity, genotype, gender identity or expression, language,
national origin, neurotype, phenotype, political beliefs, profession, race,
religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, subculture and technical
ability.

Though we welcome people fluent in all languages, SciPy development is
conducted in English.

Standards for behaviour in the SciPy community are detailed in the Code of
Conduct above. We expect participants in our community to meet these standards
in all their interactions and to help others to do so as well (see next
section).


Reporting Guidelines
--------------------

While this code of conduct should be adhered to by participants, we recognize
that sometimes people may have a bad day, or be unaware of some of the
guidelines in this code of conduct. Thus, when someone behaves in an
inappropriate way, you may reply to them and point out this code of conduct.
Such messages may be in public or in private, whatever is most appropriate.
However, regardless of whether the message is public or not, it should still
adhere to the relevant parts of this code of conduct; in particular, it should
not be abusive or disrespectful.  Assume good faith; it is more likely that
participants are unaware of their bad behaviour, rather than trying to degrade
the quality of the discussion.

Should there be difficulties in dealing with the situation, you may report your
compliance issues in confidence to either:

- The SciPy Code of Conduct Committee, at conduct@TODO (preferred)
  Members of this committee are TODO

Or alternatively to:

- Chair of the SciPy Steering Committee: Ralf Gommers
- Executive Director of NumFOCUS: Leah Silen


Incident reporting resolution & Code of Conduct enforcement
-----------------------------------------------------------

*This section summarizes the most important points, more details can be found
in* :ref:`CoC_reporting_manual`.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response
that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The SciPy Code
of Conduct Committee, and the SciPy Steering Committee (if involved), are
obligated to protect the identity of the reporter, and to treat the content of
complaints with confidentiality (unless discussed with the reporter).

There are two tracks of response; the first is for severe and obvious
breaches, where the communication involves personal threat or violent, sexist
or racist language.  We will immediately disconnect the originator from Scipy
communication channels in this case; please see the manual for details.

In cases that are less extreme, the process for acting on any received code of
conduct violation report will be:

1. acknowledge report is received
2. reasonable discussion/feedback
3. mediation (if feedback didn't help)
4. enforcement via transparent decision by the Code of Conduct Committee (if mediation failed)

The committee will respond to any report as soon as possible, and at most
within 72 hours.


Endnotes
--------

This Code defines empathy as "a vicarious participation in the emotions, ideas,
or opinions of others; the ability to imagine oneself in the condition or
predicament of another." Empathetic is the adjectival form of empathy.
